# Neovim Configuration ðŸ‘‹

Neovim configuration in only two files. ðŸŒŸ

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) installed on your system.
   - Install ripgrep (if you don't already have it): `brew install ripgrep` or `apt install ripgrep` or `yum install ripgrep`
2. **Installation**:

   - Clone this repository to your NeoVim configuration directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HenriqueMartinsBotelho/configs.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - After cloning, open NeoVim and the `init.lua` file will automatically load your new configuration.
   - You can start editing the `init.lua` file to customize your NeoVim setup. Comments in the file will guide you through the various sections and settings.
